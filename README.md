# SMART DEVICE CONTROLLER SYSTEM
Welcome to our smart home project! This system aims to provide a convenient and secure way to control and monitor your home using advanced technologies like face recognition and a voice assistant.

## Features
* Face recognition: The smart home system is equipped with a camera that can recognize the faces of authorized users. This allows for secure access to the system and personalized control of devices and settings.

* Voice assistant: The system includes a voice assistant that can be used to issue commands and control various aspects of the home. Simply say "Hey, smart home" to activate the assistant and then speak your command.

## Technical Details
The smart home system is built using a Jestson Nano as the main controller, with various sensors and devices connected . The face recognition feature is implemented using OpenCV, Dlib and the voice assistant is powered by Rasa Assistant API. The system is programmed in Python

## Development Process
Developing the smart home system was a challenging but rewarding process. One of the biggest challenges was integrating the various hardware components and making sure they all worked together smoothly. We also had to spend a lot of time fine-tuning the face recognition and voice assistant algorithms to ensure good performance.

##  How to Install and Run the Project
1. python3 -m venv .venv
2. source .venv/bin/activate
3. pip3 install -r requirements
4. ./run.sh

## Conclusion
We hope that our smart home system will make your life easier and more convenient. With the ability to control and monitor your home using face recognition and a voice assistant, you can feel confident that your home is secure and your needs are met.
